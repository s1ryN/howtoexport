# Exporting Applications from Various IDEs

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for exporting or building distributable application artifacts from the following development tools:

- **Code::Blocks**
- **IntelliJ IDEA**
- **PhpStorm**
- **MySQL Workbench**
- **Android Studio**

Each section below describes exactly which menu items or buttons to click, along with any dialog settings. All instructions are in English to ensure clarity.

---

## 1. Code::Blocks (C/C++ Projects)

### 1.1. Prepare Build Targets

1. Open your project in Code::Blocks.
2. From the top menu, select **Build → Select target** and choose **Release** (or **Debug** if you need a debug build).

### 1.2. Build Executable

1. Click **Build → Build** (or press `Ctrl+F9`).
2. Wait for the build to complete; check the **Build log** pane at the bottom for any errors.

### 1.3. Locate Output

- The compiled executable (`.exe` on Windows, or no extension on Linux/macOS) will be placed in the `bin/Release/` (or `bin/Debug/`) subfolder of your project directory.

## 2. IntelliJ IDEA (Java/Kotlin Projects)

### 2.1. Configure an Artifact

1. Open your project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Go to **File → Project Structure...** (or press `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S`).
3. In the **Project Structure** dialog, select **Artifacts** in the left panel.
4. Click the **＋** button above the artifact list and choose **JAR → From modules with dependencies...**
5. In the **Create JAR from Modules** dialog:
   - Select your module from the **Module** dropdown.
   - Optionally specify a **Main Class** if building an executable JAR.
   - Click **OK**.
6. Click **Apply**, then **OK** to close **Project Structure**.

### 2.2. Build the JAR

1. From the top menu, choose **Build → Build Artifacts...**
2. In the **Build Artifacts** popup, select **`<YourArtifactName>:jar` → Build**.
3. Wait until the build process finishes (check the **Build** tool window).

### 2.3. Find the JAR File

- The generated JAR will be in the `out/artifacts/<YourArtifactName>/` directory inside your project folder.

## 3. PhpStorm (PHP Projects)

### 3.1. Export Project as ZIP

> PhpStorm does not create a binary application, so exporting a distributable archive (ZIP) of your project files is common.

1. Open your project in PhpStorm.
2. Go to **File → Export to Zip File...**
3. In the **Export to Zip** dialog:
   - Specify the **Destination path** for the ZIP file.
   - Select any folders or file filters if needed.
4. Click **OK**.

> Alternatively, you can export IDE settings via **File → Export Settings...**, but that is for configuration, not project content.

## 4. MySQL Workbench (Database Models & Data)

### 4.1. Export EER Model to SQL Script

1. Open your `.mwb` model in MySQL Workbench.
2. From the top menu, choose **Database → Forward Engineer...**
3. In the **Forward Engineer SQL Script** wizard:
   1. Click **Next** on the introduction screen.
   2. Make sure **Export MySQL Table Objects** is checked. Click **Next**.
   3. Under **Output**, select **Export to Self-Contained File** and specify the file path.
   4. Click **Next → Next**, then **Finish**.

### 4.2. Export Actual Data (Optional)

1. Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your database server.
2. Go to **Server → Data Export**.
3. In the **Data Export** tab:
   1. Select the schema and tables you want to export.
   2. Under **Export Options**, choose **Export to Self-Contained File** or **Export to Dump Project Folder**.
   3. Specify the **Export Path**.
4. Click **Start Export** in the lower-right.

## 5. Android Studio (Android Apps)

### 5.1. Build an APK (Debug)

1. Open your Android project in Android Studio.
2. Click **Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s)**.
3. Wait for the build to complete. A notification will appear in the bottom right.
4. Click **Locate** in the notification to open the output folder (`app/build/outputs/apk/`).

### 5.2. Generate a Signed APK or App Bundle

1. Choose **Build → Generate Signed Bundle / APK...**
2. In the **Generate Signed Bundle or APK** dialog:
   1. Select **Android App Bundle** or **APK**, then click **Next**.
   2. Configure or select an existing **Key store path**, **Key alias**, and enter your passwords. Click **Next**.
   3. Choose **Release** build variant and click **Finish**.
3. After the build, click **Locate** in the Build notification to find your `.aab` or `.apk` in `app/build/outputs/`.
